      <h1>Plug.dj Playlist Exporter</h1>
      <p>
        This exports all your plug.dj playlists to YouTube <em>and SoundCloud</em>
        quickly and easily, without copying any video IDs or saving/uploading
        any files.
      </p>

      <h2>Usage</h2>
      <p>
        First, drag the button below to your bookmarks bar. Then, join any room on
        plug.dj, and press the bookmark once you can see the chat.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a class="bookmark" href="javascript:(function(){$.getScript('https://rawgit.com/goto-bus-stop/plugdj-export/master/index.js');}()); ">Export Playlists</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        When you press the bookmark, you'll be prompted to log in to your YouTube
        and SoundCloud accounts, so the bookmark can create playlists and add
        songs to them. Once that's done, every one of your playlists will be
        handled in order automatically.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's important that you don't refresh while the bookmark is running, since
        it won't have finished adding songs yet. So if you do accidentally
        refresh and re-run the bookmark, you'll end up with a bunch of duplicate
        exported playlists. You'll have to manually delete the duplicate
        playlists in that case. Or leave them be, if you don't mind duplicates!
      </p>

      <h2>Alternatives</h2>
      <p>
        Several people have built playlist exporting scripts. Some of the popular
        ones are:

        <li>
          <a href="https://p2y.thedark1337.com">Plug2YouTube</a> - Made by
          thedark1337.
          Has been around for a long time. It exports a single playlist at a time,
          but it's been known to sometimes mix up playlists when multiple people
          use it simultaneously. YouTube only.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="http://pye.sq10.net">PYE</a> - Made by Ivan.
          It exports all your playlists, similar to this bookmark. It's a bit
          harder to use, though. SoundCloud support is coming soon, apparently!
